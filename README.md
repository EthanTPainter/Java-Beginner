# Java_Beginner
Basic Java Programs to illustrate different core components of Java Programming.

# NOTE
These classes will require folder cs1, which is used for input/output management within the files. 
The reaons for this is that the textbook that was used with these sample projects all included cs1.
cs1 input/output format is very similar to other java input/output streams (BufferedReader, Scanner, etc.)

cs1 folder contains a keyboard class to read in ints, Strings, etc.
