# Java_Beginner
Basic Java Programs to illustrate different core components of Java Programming.

# NOTE
These classes will not compile on a stadard IDE. One of the files imported in each of these classes 
is cs1.Keyboard which acts similar to scanner in Java. The only difference is the Keyboard class 
doesn't need to be closed as opposed to scanner.
